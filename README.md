## Hey Zaire Read This: ##

**All of the html files are using handlebars, so you can access them in the** *views* **directory, these are all using the main template called 'main' which can be found in the** *layouts* **directory which inside the views directory. The main.css file is also in the views directory. you can copy and paste all these files or try and figure out how to use git, or whatever you wanna do :P**

*Note, if you are finding this very confusing I have put everything on a sever for you to test out, go to: http://46.101.47.26:3000/ for the home page, and for all the admin stuff go to: http://46.101.47.26:3000/blog/admin*
